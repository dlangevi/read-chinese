# Planned and Completed Features

Think of the todos as just ideas I would like to optimistically work to, and not actual roadmapped features

### Todo

#### Still Intend to Do
- [ ] add new book (without needing calibre)
- [ ] use calibre (if possible) to convert from epub etc to txt file

#### Ideas to Explore / Deprioritized Ideas
- [ ] unflag anki cards on edit
- [ ] Import from multiple anki decks
- [ ] more control over what voice is used for which purpose
- [ ] 90% test coverage for go code
- [ ] linux scrollbars dont work in webview
- [ ] create bootstrap flow that installs free books
- [ ] Support ways outside of anki for importing words 
- [ ] use forvo for term audio [unclear if possible]
- [ ] get example sentences from some online service [if free ones exist] 
- [ ] track book progress (eg 15% read)
